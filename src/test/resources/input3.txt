Not too busy just right. Went in as I got an offer for buy one get one entrée free with a purchase of two beverages.\nI ordered the jack Daniels baby back ribs with the cajun style shrimp. The tops of the baby back ribs was charred more than the normal but it was still great. \nMy friend ordered the Jack Daniels chicken with shrimp and the came out with just chicken on the plate. so we had to ask for the shrimp. They brought the shrimp out, but people around us was sending the food order back. Either the kitchen had screwed up or did the waitress. \nThe Chicken was way too peppery that made it had to eat, but had jack Daniel sauce to drown out the peppered taste.\nI've always enjoyed TGIF, but there constantly changing up there menu which is great , but for me who haven't been jack in months was a throw off for me as good thing I eat the same thing .\nEvery thing else was fine as service was up to par and we still left waitress 20% which was too much . \nAt least we got checked on by waitress and manager that was walking around.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0}

As Las Vegas is known for many chefs that open restruants he on the strip or in one of the major casinos. \nWell this on is next to the Quad by the Linqs and the new high roller.\nOnce we sat down and got our service it was below average at best. Server we had was not very accommodating and seems like the attitude was coming.\nI ordered the off the hook burger it was oil and sloppy.\nMy other party ordered the Mac and Cheese burger this one was dry and had no flavor at all.\nA side of Mac and Cheese for my baby, ate one bite and didn't want it. Other kid places that have mac and cheese he love, and this is suppose to be good?\nNot good for kids! No kids menu is offered at this place. too expensive to order for a kid or child and not worth it. \nFemale server was not helpful as I stated earlier. I ordered iced tea and I had to ask for a refill and it took forever to come back with that refill. \nI've ate at many burger places and other have not even disappointed like this one.\nAt lease if the service was superior like it should of been anyways.  at least my rating on this establishment  would of been better than a one starer. \nBut a double whammy killed it on the head!!!!!","useful":3,"funny":1,"cool":0}
