This was special evening out for my dad's birthday. first the butter rolls are to die for, but they horribly BURNT and they had the nerve to serve it. Attendant ask the Chef to make a new batch , but had to wait till they served it all. Vegetable the came with your meal was mushy and nasty, almost stink. The petite steak I order was okay, not excellent as it has in the past. This is our last visit to this place. Not paying good money for carp, when I can get better for cheaper elsewhere.  Sorry. you'll be disappointed if you dare come.","useful":0,"funny":1,"cool":0}

I just love the pancakes with the four different syrups I have a choice to choose from everytime I go and dine in.\nHaving a short stack with eggs and bacon is YUM! Having their dinner menu is OK but breakfast is better choice app IHOP anytime.\nThe only thing going at late night is that service is a little slower. Hi guess the staffing is not as well during the day . The trick is what you order your drinks water water coffee and a beverage, lol. I normally ordered orange juice or some kind of juice with the coffee.\nI need to bring back all you can eat pancakes..... \nIHOP is always fun to hang out with friends and they don't rush you at late night hours.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}
